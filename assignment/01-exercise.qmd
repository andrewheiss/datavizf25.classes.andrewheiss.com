Before starting this exercise, make sure you complete everything at [the lesson for this week](/lesson/01-lesson.qmd), especially the Posit Primers.
:::

## Instructions

1. Open the project either on your computer ([follow these instructions to get started!](/resource/install.qmd)) or in Posit.cloud

   - [{{< fa file-archive >}} `03-exercise.zip`](/projects/01-exercise.zip): If you're using R on your own computer, download this file, [*unzip it*](/resource/unzipping.qmd), and double click on the file named `03-exercise.Rproj`
   - [{{< fa cloud >}} Posit.cloud project](https://posit.cloud/spaces/679548/content/10729158): Use this link if you're using Posit.cloud in your browser

2. Rename the Quarto file named `your-name_exercise-3.qmd` to something that matches your name and open it in RStudio.

3. Complete the tasks given in the Quarto file. You can definitely copy, paste, and adapt from other code in the documentâ€”don't try to write everything from scratch!

4. When you're all done, click on the "Render" button at the top of the editing window and create a Typst (pdf), PDF, or Word version of your document. Upload that file to iCollege. **Do not upload a rendered HTML file** (they don't work on iCollege).

```{r render-button, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", indent="   ", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("/files/img/assignments/render-button.png", error = FALSE)
```

## Tips

:::: {.callout-tip}
### File organization

You'll be doing this same process for all your future exercises. Each exercise will involve a Quarto file. 

You can either create individual projects for each assignment and mini-project (recommended!):

::: {layout="[39.5,-1,60]"}

![Individual folders for each project on macOS](/files/img/reference/rproj-multiple-folders-macos.png)

![Individual folders for each project on Windows](/files/img/reference/rproj-multiple-folders-windows.png)
:::

Or you can create a new RStudio Project directory for all your work (not recommended!):

::: {layout="[53,-1,39]"}

![One folder for everything on macOS](/files/img/reference/rproj-one-folder-macos.png)

![One folder for everything on Windows](/files/img/reference/rproj-one-folder-windows.png)
